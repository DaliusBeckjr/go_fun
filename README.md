# go_fun
 this is a repository for my notes and projects when I am learning go and the basics to advancements of it


notes are provided in each folder as I learn this language
and there will be a readme in each notes folder of each section 
showing the order of each content to read and a link to each of those. Just in case someone 
comes and wants to learn from my notes 

Disclaimer: you can add more to the course if you have some questions that aren't added for 
the simplicity of others and you can add quizes to each one if you feel like 
there needs to be more of a study around this

this was made specifically for my understanding and will be updated with time as it goes

thank you for the free knowledge and ease of access, this is not here for any way shape or form for me to profit off of this as I am a self-taught SWE but want to enlighten the next generation that there are other alternatives if you are having a difficult time financially.
