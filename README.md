# GO Fundamentals
This is a repository for my notes and projects when I am learning go and the basics to advancements of it.


Notes are provided in each folder as I learn this language
and there will be a readme in each notes folder of each section 
showing the order of each content to read and a link to each of those. Just in case someone 
comes and wants to learn from my notes 

**_Disclaimer_:** You can add more to the course if you have some questions that aren't added for 
the simplicity of others and you can add quizes to each one if you feel like 
there needs to be more of a study around this.

This was made specifically for my understanding and will be updated with time.

## Introduction

**_Another note_:** I would recommend starting at python or even javascript to be your first language when coding since I found them to be much more simpler to understand at the start. Based on Python for having a very simple syntax and readability and even javascript (JS) for having also a key understanding for data structures and algorithms plus it pretty much goes hand in hand when you start learning HTML and CSS. Getting into the functionality of the website you would use JS. Then I would recommend another thing for the JS route is learning (ES6+). My fav in my opinion.
