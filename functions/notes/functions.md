# Functions


A functions in Go can take more that one argument and other cases they can have zero Arguments


<p>
to make Go easier to read, the variable type would come after the variable name
</P>

example:
```go
func sub(x int, y int) int { 
    return x - y
}
```

it accepts to two integers param and returns another integer

here <mark> func sub(x int, y int) int </mark> is known as a "function signature"
