# Introduction

<p> (disclaimer): I would recommend starting at python or even javascript to be your first language when coding since I found them to be much more simpler to understand at the start. Based on Python for having a very simple syntax and readability and even javascript (JS) for having also a key understanding for data structures and algorithms plus it pretty much goes hand in hand when you start learning HTML and CSS. Getting into the functionality of the website you would use JS. Then I would recommend another thing for the JS route is learning (ES6+). My fav in my opinion. </p>

<p> Go is fast but yet simple but yet much different from a compile language </p>
